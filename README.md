# IdleBrains

The Main aim of IdleBrains is to help developers find projects to work on, and learn as a community.

In our slack channel `Ideas`, members can share their project ideas and other members can show their interest by voting for their favorite ideas and collaboratively work on their favorite projects.

### I'm interested, How can I join? 
It's simple, 

First Create an [issue](https://github.com/IdleBrains/IdleBrains-About/issues) in this repo, with the title `Join IdleBrains` and specify the languages/tech you are comfortable working with, and one of our members will add you to this organization.

Then, Join us on Slack [here](https://join.slack.com/t/idle-brains/shared_invite/enQtMjY4MjkxMjcxMTM3LTY1ZGM3MTBkNjA5NjU5ZWUxMWZlMzQxZTMyNmMyNmEyN2E2YzJiMzIwMWRhY2QxMzgwYWUxZGYzM2E2NmMyYWE) to communicate with other members.

Happy Hacking :)
